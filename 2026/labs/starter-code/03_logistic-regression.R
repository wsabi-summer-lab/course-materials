# load data
field_goals = read_csv("../data/03_field-goals.csv.gz")

# Task 1:
# - Fit at least 3 competing models for field-goal success probability
# - Include at least one linear regression and at least one logistic regression
# - Consider whether kicker quality should enter the model
# - Inspect the data as needed and write down each model clearly

# Task 2:
# - Compare the models using out-of-sample predictive performance
# - Use log loss as the main metric
# - If using cross-validation, report mean test log loss and its standard error across folds
# - Select a preferred model and explain why

# Task 3:
# - Report coefficient estimates, standard errors, and 95% confidence intervals for the selected logistic model
# - Interpret the selected model's coefficients on the log-odds scale
# - When useful, exponentiate coefficients and interpret them as odds ratios

# Task 4:
# - Plot the selected model's predictions against the actual outcomes
# - Plot the selected model's predicted make probability as a function of yardline
# - Add a 95% confidence ribbon for the fitted probability
# - Bin the data by yardline and compare fitted probabilities to observed make rates
# - Comment on where the model fits well and where it misses

# Task 1:
# - Filter the NCAA results to the 2023-2024 season
# - Recode the data into a Bradley-Terry model dataset like the one from lecture
# - Make sure you can identify the home team, away team, and binary game outcome

# Task 2:
# - Fit a Bradley-Terry logistic regression model
# - Include a home-court advantage term
# - State the identifiability convention you will use for team ratings

# Task 3:
# - Visualize the fitted team ratings
# - Join team names back onto the fitted coefficients so the ratings are interpretable
# - Add uncertainty intervals for the ratings or for rating differences
# - Explain what a larger team rating means
# - Explain why rating differences are often more meaningful than raw levels
# - Identify the strongest teams under your fitted model

# Task 4:
# - Choose one or more team comparisons and compute win probabilities from the fitted model
# - For at least one matchup, quantify uncertainty in the predicted probability
# - Make sure your probability calculation matches your identifiability convention

# Task 5:
# - For the Purdue vs UConn national-title game, set beta_0 = 0 for a neutral site
# - Report the estimated win probability for each team
# - Compute an approximate 95% confidence interval for the win probability
# - Convert the point estimate and both confidence-interval endpoints into moneyline prices
# - Briefly explain that this interval reflects uncertainty in the fitted probability, not certainty about one game outcome

# General uncertainty requirements:
# - For each logistic regression model you fit, report coefficient estimates, standard errors,
#   and 95% confidence intervals
# - For team comparisons, focus on uncertainty in rating differences
