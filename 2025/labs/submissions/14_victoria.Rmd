Preliminary Data Cleaning

```{r}

library(rstan)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

nfl = read.csv("../data/14_nfl-games.csv")
head(nfl)

nfl <- nfl %>% 
  mutate(s_i = season - 2018,
         home_team = as.factor(home_team),
         away_team = as.factor(away_team),
         home_win = (total_home_score - total_away_score)
           )
```

Task 1 - fit model

```{r}
stan_model <- stan_model(file = "team_hfa.stan")
```


When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
